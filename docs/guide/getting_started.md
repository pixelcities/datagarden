# Getting started

In DataGarden, you will mostly be working within a **data space**. Data spaces are generally created to bring together
different people and organisations to work towards a common objective, so that they can work within the same
environment. Within a data space, all members can collaborate by building workflows and/or reports. The data itself
is not shared by default. Together with built-in privacy controls, you can safely upload or link your source data to the
data space, and start working together with others, without sharing any sensitive data or having to filter your source
data locally, in ways that are not reproducible in the long run.

To start of, you have the option to join the *trial data space* when you create an account. This is a special demo area
where you can get familiar with the platform. The trial data space is reset regularly, so it should not be used for any
purposes other than testing out the platform.

> **Note**: Because data spaces are meant for collaborators, and the trial space may have any number of unwanted members,
> your personal information is redacted as a precaution. You can leave the trial space at any time.

Based on your goals, you may only want or need to interact with a subset of the data space. For example, if you are
only submitting some private data to enable other collaborators to build a workflow, you have different requirements
from let's say, a collaborator that is writing the copy for a report. Feel free to jump ahead where needed.

Now, let's get started familiarizing ourselves with the data space.
