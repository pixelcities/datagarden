# CSV

Uploads a CSV file. The delimiter, quotechar, and data types are automatically guessed. It is good practice to double
check that the data types are as you expect by viewing the linked concepts in the Taxonomy overview.

## Notes
- CSV sources cannot currently be updated
- It is recommended to keep the file upload size under 100MB (millions of rows, depending on your data)
