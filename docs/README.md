# Introduction

Welcome to **DataGarden**, an end-to-end encrypted data collaboration platform. DataGarden allows you to share and analyse
data securely, with an emphasis on gaining insights on data that is owned by different parties. DataGarden is structured
around the building of workflows, visually, with built-in controls to manage data ownership and privacy. The results
from your data analysis can be dynamically embedded into a report, and shared publically with a simple URL. Finally,
this can all be done from the comfort of your browser, no deployments necessary.

- Collaborate in your own private data space
- Keep your pivate data private through detailed access controls
- Create reproducible workflows, visually
- Share your results, knowing that the data is always up to date

This documentation consists of two parts: a *user guide* and a *reference manual*. If this is your first time using
DataGarden, you can follow along the user guide to learn the general principles behind the platform. If you are already
familiar, or want to figure it out yourself, the reference manual contains more detailed information of each module.
